# SongCensor
A simple BSIPA mod that allows you to mute songs during gameplay.

# Installing
Place the DLL files into your game install's 'Plugins' folder. Requires BSIPA, SongCore, SiraUtil, and BSML to be installed too.

# Usage
By default, the mod does nothing on it's own. To add a song to the list of muted songs, select the song in the 'Solo' Menu and use the mod's gameplay setup tab to add it to the list of songs to mute. The menu music should fade back to default and the song should not play when you play the level.
You can remove songs from the list by selecting a song from the list in the gameplay setup tab and pressing the 'Remove' button.
